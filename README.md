# SSConstruction-Freelance
<p>A Freelance project I was contracted to work on in 2022.</p>
<p>Based on their product requirements I built a static single page application using vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
<p>Upon completion the project was hosted on https://ssconstruction-co.github.io/. </p>
